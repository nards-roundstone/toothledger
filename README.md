# ToothLedger 🦷

ToothLedger is a simple, chairside tooth map companion built around the FDI notation system.

It allows dentists to visually explain a patient’s current tooth condition and lets patients take that same tooth map home on their phone via QR scan—no accounts, no friction.

This project is intentionally lightweight, privacy-friendly, and designed for real clinic workflows.
